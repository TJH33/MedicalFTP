# Medical Data Evaluation
This project simulates a scenario where data, in a CSV format, is stored on an private FTP server and a client-side program is required to perform two functions:
* Automated Collection of the CSV files at regular intervals.
* A UI application which can retrieve the CSV files from a given point in time.

Alongside this, the CSV files have to meet given requirements in order to be considered valid.
